## Pseudocode for DFS

```pseudocode
DFS(graph):
    for v of graph.verts:
        v.color = white
        v.parent = null

    for v of graph.verts:
        if v.color == white:
            DFS_visit(v)

DFS_visit(v):
    v.color = gray

    for neighbor of v.adjacent_nodes:
        if neighbor.color == white:
            neighbor.parent = v
            DFS_visit(neighbor)

    v.color = black
