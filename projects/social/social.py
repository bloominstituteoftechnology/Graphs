3. Questions

1. 5000 times, because the friendships are bi-directional, one call of
add_friendship() gives friends to two people.

2. I wouldn't know exactly- there's probably some math formula to
figure it out, but from a couple runs, the average number of people
in the person's extended list was 960, so about 96% I would guess.
