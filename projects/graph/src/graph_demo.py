# The main parameters should be the number of vertices and the number of edges 
# - for instance, you could have 4 vertices and 6 edges.
# Edges should by default by bidirectional, be added randomly and should be unique. 
# You should pick reasonable default parameters, but also allow them to be passed in as arguments.
# You can use argv (already imported) to parse command line arguments, e.g. python graph_demo.py arg1 arg2
