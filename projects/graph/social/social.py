"""
1. To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call `addFriendship()`? Why?
    100 * 10 //2 => 500 Each instance of addFriendship() creates two friendships so it only needs to be called half as many times as the total number of friendships.
2. If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users will be in a particular user's extended social network? What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in his/her extended network?
    Nearly 99% and average degree of separation is about 5
