#3. Questions
#1. To create 100 users with an average of 10 friends each, how many times would you need to call addFriendship()? Why?
# 100 users with 10 friends each would equal 1000 connections, but since connections are bidirectional you would 
# only have to call addFriendship 500 times.
#2. If you create 1000 users with an average of 5 random friends each, what percentage of other users will be in a 
# particular userâ€™s extended social network? What is the average degree of separation between a user and those in 
# his/her extended network?
