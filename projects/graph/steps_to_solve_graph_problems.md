# 3 Steps to solve any graph problem:

### 1.  Translate the problem into Graph terminology
    - Figure out what are your nodes and edges
    - Is it a dense or sparse Graph
    - Is it cyclic or acyclic
    - Is it directed or undirected

### 2.  Build your graph
    - Add vertices
    - Add edges

### 3. Traverse your graph
    - Memorize the algorithm pseudocode
