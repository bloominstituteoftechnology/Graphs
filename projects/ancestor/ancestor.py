# Earliest Ancestor

# so were goign to be given a dataset and an id
# of an individual of that dataset as arguments.

# an individual is represented as an id.

# individual ID's are unique.

# we could represent a data set as a tree like so:
'''
 10
 /
1   2   4  11
 \ /   / \ /
  3   5   8
   \ / \   \
    6   7   9
'''
# with the sample input looking something like:
'''
Example input
  6

  1 3
  2 3
  3 6
  5 6
  5 7
  4 5
  4 8
  8 9
  11 8
  10 1
Example output
  10
'''


'''
Clarifications:

The input will not be empty.
There are no cycles in the input.
There are no "repeated" ancestors â€“ if two individuals are connected, it is by exactly one path.
IDs will always be positive integers.
A parent may have any number of children.
'''

# off the bat it seems to me like were really only concerned with parent relationships.
# were never going down the graph, only searching up.

# we can create a graph which specifies parents to nodes such as:
'''
{
    node: [parent]
    node: [parent, parent]
    node: []
}
'''

# then, starting at our selected node, check that we have any parents

# if no parents are found, we can simply return -1
# if there are multiple closest common ancestors, i.e. in the above example:
# 8 is a child of both 4 and 11
# we return the parent with the lowest numeric ID


# heres my plan

# 1. populate a graph in the fashion shown above..
# 2. check to see if the list at that graph node is empty. if it is, return -1
# 3. if its not, wel create a stack, initialize with our first ancestor,
# and loop over each of the first common ancestors.
# 4. wel create a list for each ancestor addition, starting with our starting node, and append the ancestor
# 5. now we have a Stack (havent decided yet) of all possible relationships 1 ancestor away.
# 6. wel continue to do this until were at the top of each ancestors list
# 7. we can now check to see which list is the longest/handel all cases
