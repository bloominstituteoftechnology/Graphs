"""
Target node is set to none because we don't actually know what we're looking for... yet

Path is the result of the DFS where we are seeing how far away 
the each node is from the starting node

If path returns something
And the length of the path is greater than the current longest path
Set the target_node to the node we are on

If path doesn't return anything AND the longest_path is 1
Set target node it -1; No idea why, but that's what the test calls for

At the end, return the target node

The loop will run over every node, only updating the longest_path/target_node when the 
current node is further away from the previous node

The loop will automatically break when path doesn't return anything
