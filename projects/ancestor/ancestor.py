# Suppose we have some input data describing a graph of relationships between parents and children over multiple generations.
# The data is formatted as a list of (parent, child) pairs, where each individual is assigned a unique integer identifier.

# For example, in this diagram and the sample input, 3 is a child of 1 and 2, and 5 is a child of 4:

# ```
#  10
#  /
# 1   2   4  11
#  \ /   / \ /
#   3   5   8
#    \ / \   \
#     6   7   9
# ```

# Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns their earliest known ancestor 
# â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual.
# If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID.
# If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.
