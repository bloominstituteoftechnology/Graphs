# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns 
# the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are 
# connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:

# islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#            [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

# island_counter(islands) # returns 4
