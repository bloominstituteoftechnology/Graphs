""" Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands.
An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:
islands = [
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

# Solution: Turn this into a graph..what would be a vertex?
