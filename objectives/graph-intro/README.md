## Objectives

* Learn what graphs are
* Learn the components of graphs
* Learn what graphs are useful for

## What Are Graphs?

Graphs are collections of related data. They're like trees, except
connections can be made from any node to any other node, even forming
loops.

The nodes in a graph are called _vertexes_ (or _vertices_ or _verts_),
and the connections between the verts are called _edges_.

And edge denotes a relationship or linkage between the two verts.

## What can they represent?

Graphs can represent any kind of multiway relational data.

This could be a collection of cities and linking roads.

It could be a collection of computers on a network.

It could be a population of people know know each other and [Kevin
Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon).

It could represent trade relationships between nations.

And so on.


## Definitions

### Directed/Undirected Graphs

If the edges are "one way" (have an arrow), the graph is said to be a
_directed graph_. If there are no arrows, the edges are bidirectional
and the graph is an _undirected_ graph.

### Cyclic/Acyclic Graphs

If a cycle can be formed (e.g. you can follow the edges and arrive again
at an already-visited vert), the graph is _cyclic_. Otherwise it is
_acyclic_

### Weighted Graphs

Graphs with values (_weights_) associated with the edges are called
_weighted graphs_.

The meaning of the weight is dependent on the type of graph. A graph of
road network segments might have weight represent the length of the
road. The higher the total weight of a route on the graph, the longer
the trip is. The weights can be used to help decide if a particular
route should be chosen over another.

Weights can be further modified. For example, if one were building a
bicycle map, roads with bad car traffic or very steep uphills could be
given unnaturally large weights so a routing algorithm would be unlikely
to take them. (This is how Google Maps avoids freeways when you ask it
for walking directions.)

### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

A _directed acyclic graph_ (_DAG_) has a number of applications. From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph):

> DAGs can model many different kinds of information. A spreadsheet can
> be modeled as a DAG, with a vertex for each cell and an edge whenever
> the formula in one cell uses the value from another; a topological
> ordering of this DAG can be used to update all cell values when the
> spreadsheet is changed. Similarly, topological orderings of DAGs can
> be used to order the compilation operations in a makefile. The program
> evaluation and review technique uses DAGs to model the milestones and
> activities of large human projects, and schedule these projects to use
> as little total time as possible. Combinational logic blocks in
> electronic circuit design, and the operations in dataflow programming
> languages, involve acyclic networks of processing elements. DAGs can
> also represent collections of events and their influence on each
> other, either in a probabilistic structure such as a Bayesian network
> or as a record of historical data such as family trees or the version
> histories of distributed revision control systems. DAGs can also be
> used as a compact representation of sequence data, such as the
> directed acyclic word graph representation of a collection of strings,
> or the binary decision diagram representation of sequences of binary
> choices.

It's notable that git uses a DAG to represent commits. A commit can have a child
commit, or more than one child commit (in the case of a branch). A child could
come from one parent commit, or from two (in the case of a merge). But there's
no way to go back and form a repeating loop in the git commit hierarchy.

## Exercises

Draw examples of the following:

* Undirected graph of 4 verts.
* Directed graph of 5 verts.
* Cyclic directed graph of 6 verts.
* DAG of 7 verts.
