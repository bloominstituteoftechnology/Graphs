## Main Goals

* [X] Implement a `Graph` class that supports the API expected by `draw.py`.
* [X] Implement the `BokehGraph` class in `draw.py` which works with `Graph` object instances.
* [ ] Draw a Random Graph
* [ ] Implement either Breadth-First Search of Depth-First Search

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Color the connected components differently.
* [ ] Add a UI Button to generate a new graph.
* [ ] Add random edge weights.
* [ ] Figure out which vertex a user is clicking on when they click with a mouse.
* [ ] Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm

*Stretch goals may become main goals later in the week.*
