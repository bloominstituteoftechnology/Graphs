Graphs
------
Nodes connected by edges
Vertexes
Vertices
Verts
Directed vs undirected
    Directed has one-way edges
Cyclic vs Acyclic:
    Cyclic has a way to get back to a node you've already visited
Weighted edges:
    "Cost" with traversing an edge
Traversals:
Breadth-first traversal
Depth-first traversal
LL:
cur = head
while cur is not None:
    print(cur)
    cur = cur.next
Binary Tree:
traverse(node):
    if node is None: return
    traverse(node.left)
    print(node)
    traverse(node.right)
