def bfs(self, starting_vertex_id, target_vertex_id):
    # Create an empty queue and enqueue A PATH TO the starting vertex ID
    # Create a Set to store visited vertices
    # While the queue is not empty...
        # Dequeue the first PATH
        # Grab the last vertex from the PATH
        # If that vertex has not been visited...
            # CHECK IF IT'S THE TARGET
              # IF SO, RETURN PATH
            # Mark it as visited...
            # Then add A PATH TO its neighbors to the back of the queue
              # COPY THE PATH
              # APPEND THE NEIGHOR TO THE BACK

Graphs
------
Nodes == Verts == Verticies == Vertexes
      The thing that stores the data

Nodes connected by Edges

      Edges can be directional

if a graph has directional edges, it's called a 'directed graph'


Traversal
---------

Keep track of what nodes have beed visited to avoid revisiting them

      * Visited flag
      * Hash Table
      * Set

  
Depth-First Travesal
--------------------

Push starting node on stack

whole stack isn't empty:
      pop the node off the top of the stack
      if node isn't visited:
          visit the node (e.g print9 it out)
          mark it as visited
          push all its neighbors on the stack

Breadth-First Traversal
-----------------------

Add starting node to queue

while queue isn't empty:
      take the node from the front of the queue
      if node isn't visited:
          visit the node (e.g print9 it out)
          mark it as visited
          push all its neighbors on the stack



Graph Representation
--------------------

How we store the graph in memory

1. Adjacency matrix
2. Adjacency list

Matrix:

A matrix is a grid. Keep track of which nodes connect to others.


  A B C D E F G H       To
A   T   T       T
B     T
C T           T 
D 
E 
F 
G     T 
H T


From


List:
Keep list of nodes this one is connected to

A  [B H D]
B  [C A F E]
C  [B G]
D [A]
E [B]
F [B]
G [C H]
H [G A]

  -----------------------------
  A hash table that just stores True/False values is equivalent to a Set.S
